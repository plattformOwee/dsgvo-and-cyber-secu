Excellent, you have provided a comprehensive overview of your backend data, which is the perfect starting point for Phase 1: Data Inventory & Lawful Basis.

Based on the information you've shared, we can create a solid foundation for your Record of Processing Activities (RoPA). Below is a preliminary analysis and a draft RoPA.

### Data Inventory Analysis

From your database schemas, API files, and logs, we can identify the following categories of personal data being processed:

*   **Identity & Account Data:** Includes name, email address, password hash, and unique identifiers for user accounts, devices, and authentication.
*   **Profile Information:** This is data users provide to describe themselves, such as first and last name, age, profile pictures, and languages spoken.
*   **Special Categories of Personal Data:** Your app processes several types of sensitive data that are granted special protection under the GDPR. This includes gender, political opinions, and religious beliefs.
*   **User-Generated Content:** This includes answers to profile questions, "icebreaker" answers, and voice memos.
*   **Location Data:** You store the user's location (latitude and longitude) to power the location-based search functionality.
*   **Chat & Messaging Data:** This includes the content of messages, voice messages, reactions, game invites, and location sharing within chats.
*   **Technical & Security Data:** This encompasses data like IP addresses (implicitly from web server logs), device hardware IDs, login timestamps, and verification statuses.
*   **User Preferences:** Data on what a user is looking for, including gender, age range, religion, and political views of potential matches.

### Draft "Rechtsgrundlagen-Matrix" (Lawful Basis Matrix) & RoPA Skeleton

Here is a draft of your RoPA. It combines the data inventory with the purpose of processing and the corresponding legal basis under the GDPR.

**Please note:** This is a draft. To complete it, you will need to provide the information requested in the "What's Missing?" section below.


*This table represents a simplified version of a RoPA. A complete RoPA would have additional columns as noted below.*

### Is This Enough for a Complete RoPA?

No, while you've provided an excellent and detailed starting point, a complete and comprehensive RoPA requires additional information that is not present in your backend data dump. The GDPR requires a holistic view of your data processing activities.

Here is what you still need to determine and document:

1.  **Data Recipients / Sub-Processors:** Who else receives this data? Your `Sub-Processors & DPAs` phase indicates you are aware of this. You need to list all third-party services you use, for example:
    *   **Hosting Provider:** Where are your database and servers located? (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, a specific hosting company).
    *   **Push Notification Service:** Do you use a service like Firebase Cloud Messaging or Apple Push Notification Service?
    *   **Analytics Services:** Do you use any services to track app usage or user behavior?
    *   **Email Delivery Service:** How are verification emails sent?

2.  **Data Retention Periods:** How long do you store each category of data? You need to define specific timeframes. For instance:
    *   How long is a user's data kept after they delete their account?
    *   How long are chat messages stored?
    *   Are log files automatically deleted after a certain period (e.g., 30 days)?

3.  **Cross-Border Data Transfers:** Do any of your sub-processors transfer data outside of the European Union/European Economic Area? If so, you must document the legal safeguards in place for these transfers (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses).

4.  **Technical and Organisational Measures (TOMs):** You need a general description of your security measures. This doesn't mean revealing security secrets, but describing the types of measures in place, such as:
    *   **Encryption:** Is data encrypted at rest (in the database) and in transit (using HTTPS/TLS)? Your API file list suggests you are using HTTPS.
    *   **Access Control:** How do you restrict access to the backend systems and databases?
    *   **Password Hashing:** You are using `password_hash`, which is great. You should specify the algorithm used (e.g., bcrypt).
    *   **Data Minimization:** Are you only collecting the data you absolutely need?

5.  **Data Protection Officer (DPO):** Have you appointed a DPO? If so, their contact details must be in the RoPA.

To move forward, your next steps should be to gather the information listed above. This will allow you to create a truly comprehensive RoPA that fulfills the requirements of Article 30 of the GDPR.
