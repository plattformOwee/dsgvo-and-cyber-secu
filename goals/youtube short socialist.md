essentially there exist robots and humans in this economy.
Robots that are being used by humans to produce things.
The more automation (robots in the furthest sense) humans use, the more efficient they become, meaning, they produce more stuff.
This is Productivity per worker since xy. And this: [animation of graph (zoomed in widht)] is real wages compared to inflation.
And this [corperate profits] are corperate profits in that time. 
So its clear where all that money is going.
But we never stop to ask why?
But the answer is clear.
We, the workers, don't get a fair share of the profits infact, we dont get a share of it at all. Not in percent of profits we generated that is.
We instead are getting an hourly pay.
For our Boss (for the capitalists at large) we are nothing more than a resource that costs Money, they what happens with the Product and what happens with the profit and they will give us, as little as they possibly can.
If we had not rebelled back then and united as workers and fought for more, for Weekends, 8 hour workdays, for holidays, for sick leave (people behind moon and US still dont all have that) for every little consession our corporate overlords and politicians have given us, we had to fight and beg and they could take it from us at any fucking point.
On Top, less people need to unite. But if we, the workers of the Nation and the World unite and demand what is ours and what has been apropriated from us for to long, given down from generation to generation, reinforcing this cycle of inequality where 99% work for the 1%.
