The "woven" dating app will be the product.

USP's: 

1. icebreaker games:
User can send minigame-request in chat, users can play minigames and even request voicechat to get to know each other 

2. "open to" ontop of "hobbies": 
we ask "what activities are you open to explore" not just "what do you already do often" so people can explore new possibilities together 

3. date suggestions: 
We show concrete date suggestions in the profile with price, navigation and hours based on the dating radius and the "open to" activities.

Other features (not exclusive to woven):

1. reorderable profile:
Whilst the app does suggest a automatically sorted Profile, the user can reorder it by dragging the elements around allowing them exact control over their self-presentation.

2. likable elements:
every element can be clicked and commented on functioning as both the first message and like at the same time.

3. unsolicited image protection:
Users must mutually request and grant the permission to send any images.

Explain your decision regarding location.

I'm from here.

This brings several advantages for the short term but the most significant is, that we will have our mvp launch and first paying users here as i can do local marketing most effectively here as i am very connected in my community.
 
I also personally know a german IT-broker who knows somebody specializing in DSGVO-complience and cyber security so my personal contacts again allow me to clear these hurdles most easily here in Germany.

Thus our first customers will be from germany and if the customer base is here and the operations mostly aswell, we will be required to pay the taxes here according to my research.

I can furthermore get guidance on local law and how to set up the company way easier as all people i could ask only have experience here.

But longterm, i would be willing to choose the best option according to experts in corporate structuring and finance.

How far along are you?

App-development:

I have a working flutter app with every of the features usable accept paying the monthly subscription and the date suggestions on the profiles. (flutter + php + mongodb)

I'm currently implementing all mesures to ensure DSGVO-compliance and cyber security. 
My work will be validated by an expert whom i got to know through personal connections according to which, he specializes exactly in managing projects to be cyber secure and DSGVO / gdpr compliant. From him i hope to know when, i will have fullfilled all neccessary conditions to launch the app to reach the first customers and finally put the idea to the test.



Investment:

Two weeks ago i held my first pitch.
The Feedback boiled down to:
- Idea easy to sell but the team not yet
- the App is not far enough to go to investors
