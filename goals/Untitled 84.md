Okay what i really want in the end is, to get to market as quickly as possible and to do that i need to sign up a company (the app name can be different anyways but as long as i have a company i can publish the app with google pay and thus receive money and thus clear "proof of concept" such that i can then go infront of investors.

That is the main Goal.

The question is, what is the quickest (save) option?
